This package allows for registering dynamic routes served from the database. Such dynamic routes can be set-up to work like normal Laravel routes using the implemented route handlers or to do completely custom actions by implementing simple handlers on your own.

### Documentation
Documentation is available in on the official Elements Framework [website](http://elements.sethera.tech/docs/master/dynamic-routing).
