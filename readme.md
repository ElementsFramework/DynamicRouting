# Laravel Dynamic Routing

**STATUS:** In development

This package allows for registering dynamic routes served from the database. Such dynamic routes can be set-up to work like normal Laravel routes using the implemented route handlers or to do completely custom actions by implementing simple handlers on your own.

*Full documentation will be available once the inital package implementation has been completed.*
